# Git Branching Name Strategies

Git branching name strategies are essential for maintaining a clear and organized workflow, especially in collaborative projects. Here are some common strategies and conventions for naming Git branches:

## 1. Feature Branches
**Purpose:** Used to develop new features for the upcoming release.  
**Naming Convention:** `feature/feature-name`  
**Example:** `feature/user-authentication`

## 2. Bugfix Branches
**Purpose:** Used to fix bugs in the current release.  
**Naming Convention:** `bugfix/issue-id-description` or `fix/issue-id-description`  
**Example:** `bugfix/1234-fix-login-error`

## 3. Hotfix Branches
**Purpose:** Used to patch critical issues in the production codebase.  
**Naming Convention:** `hotfix/issue-id-description`  
**Example:** `hotfix/5678-fix-critical-security-bug`

## 4. Release Branches
**Purpose:** Used to prepare a new production release. Allows for final bug fixes and preparation.  
**Naming Convention:** `release/version-number`  
**Example:** `release/1.0.0`

## 5. Development Branch
**Purpose:** A main branch where the development of features, bug fixes, etc., happens. This is usually the branch where integration occurs before release.  
**Naming Convention:** `develop`  
**Example:** `develop`

## 6. Main/Master Branch
**Purpose:** The stable branch where the code is always production-ready.  
**Naming Convention:** `main` or `master`  
**Example:** `main`

## 7. Experiment Branches
**Purpose:** Used for experiments or testing new ideas that may or may not make it into production.  
**Naming Convention:** `experiment/description`  
**Example:** `experiment/test-new-cache-strategy`

## 8. Task Branches
**Purpose:** Used for specific tasks that might not be feature or bug-related.  
**Naming Convention:** `task/description`  
**Example:** `task/update-dependencies`

## 9. Chore Branches
**Purpose:** Used for routine tasks like updating documentation, refactoring, or cleaning up code.  
**Naming Convention:** `chore/description`  
**Example:** `chore/refactor-auth-module`

## 10. Epic Branches
**Purpose:** Used to manage larger bodies of work that encompass multiple features or tasks.  
**Naming Convention:** `epic/epic-name`  
**Example:** `epic/overhaul-ui-design`

## 11. Support Branches
**Purpose:** Used for supporting specific releases or maintaining older versions.  
**Naming Convention:** `support/version-number`  
**Example:** `support/1.0.x`

## 12. Custom Branch Prefixes
**Purpose:** Sometimes, teams use custom prefixes to better align with their workflows, such as `dev/`, `spike/`, or `research/`.  
**Naming Convention:** `prefix/description`  
**Example:** `spike/investigate-new-logging-library`

## Best Practices
- **Use Hyphens for Readability:** Separate words in branch names with hyphens rather than underscores or camelCase.
- **Be Descriptive:** Ensure branch names clearly convey the purpose of the branch.
- **Use Issue Tracker IDs:** If your team uses an issue tracker (e.g., Jira), including the issue ID in the branch name can make it easier to track work.
- **Keep Names Short and Concise:** While being descriptive is important, keeping branch names manageable in length is equally crucial.

These strategies can be adapted based on your team's needs and the specific project you're working on.
